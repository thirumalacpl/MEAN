1. install cli globally
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    what specific version - npm install -g @angular/cli@16.0.0

2. check cli version ----> ng version

3. create new project ----> ng new angular_jwt

4. start development server ---> ng serve

5. create component ----> ng generate component component-name or ng g c component-name

6. app-routing.module.ts ---> config routes


7. Installing NgRx and RxJS - https://medium.com/@nateogbonna/making-api-calls-efficiently-with-ngrx-and-rxjs-in-angular-50ce6f2c8267
    npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects rxjs
if install error, use npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects rxjs --legacy-peer-deps or install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects rxjs --force

Difference b/w

--legacy-peer-deps -------------> 	 ignores peer dependencies entirely, which can screw up your dependency resolution.

--force command --------------- > 	force with many dependencies will increase your total space requirement a decent amount.

ng serve vs npm start

ng serve is used specifically for running an Angular project locally during development, providing a development server and automatic reloading. On the other hand, 

`npm start` is a more generic command used in Node.js projects to execute a command specified in the `start` script, often used for starting an application in a production environment.
